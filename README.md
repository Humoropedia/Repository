Humoropedia.com is a media sharing site that aims to bring its users the best of funny jokes and inspirational quotes. It has a huge collection of famous quotes about life by many different authors. We are especially proud of our collection of [Rumi Quotes](http://humoropedia.com/best-rumi-quotes-on-life-and-love/) about love and life. Each of our collections has been assembled by hand. We aim to be different from all other sites that provide quotes and jokes because we aim to provide users with a much better user experience that works both on mobile and desktop. Another reason we are different is that we believe in doing things in a slightly quirky manner, so all of us here are a little quirky. One of our favorite movies of all time is Big Lebowski, so we have a collection of quotes from that movie on [our site](http://humoropedia.com/big-lebowski-quotes/). You can also find lots of other awesome content on our site. Anyone interested in working with us to create the best entertainment site ever is welcome to contact us.
